# metamutation
A short tutorial level for a flash video game I planned to make in my senior year of high school. Multiple formats are included for viewing ease.
# viewing
The SWF is available, but opening the html file with chrome is probably the simplest way.
This project requires flash.
This project has not been optimized for performance.
# building upon this
Aside from perhaps modifying the code to run efficiently, I am probably not going to build upon this further. I am not going to be mad if you fork to improve it. I believe most of the files are for things I never actually implemented. (more levels, more enemies, a broader ecosystem for spreading mutations)
